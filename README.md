# Programming Exercises
Programming Exercises is a repository for anyone wanting to improve
their coding and problem solving skill.

Every directory has a list of programming exercises from a variety of
web pages and books.

You can make this exercises in your preferred programming language, but
we're focusing in the C++ programming language and developing in Linux.
Every problem has a txt file that define the problem.

## Requirements
- Linux
  - If you are new to Linux I'd recommed install [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
  - If you don't want to install another system on you PC you can go with
    [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)

Once you have Linux installed you need to have the following programs:
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [make](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mak)
- [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)

## Where to start?
First you need to have the repository in your local machine:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Andrsrz/programming-exercises
cd programming-exercises/
```
If you know your way in C++ you can go directly to [problem-solving](https://github.com/Andrsrz/programming-exercises/tree/master/problem-solving).
If not then go to [cpp-course](https://github.com/Andrsrz/programming-exercises/tree/master/cpp-course) directory and follow in order.
