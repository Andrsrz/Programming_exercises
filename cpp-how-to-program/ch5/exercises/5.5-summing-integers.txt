5.5 Summing Integers.
Write a program that uses a for statement to sum a sequence of integers.
Assume that the first integer read specifies the number of values remaining to be entered.
Your program should read only one value per input statement.
A typical input sequence might be : 5 100 200 300 400 500
where the 5 indicates that the subsequent 5 values are to be summed.
