5.13 Bar Chart.

One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs and bar charts.
Write a program that reads five numbers (each between 1 and 30). Assume that
the user enters only valid values. For each number that is read, your program
should print a line containing that number of adjacent asterisks.
For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should print ******* .
