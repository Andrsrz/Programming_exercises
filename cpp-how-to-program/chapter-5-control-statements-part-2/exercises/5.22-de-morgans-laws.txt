5.22 De Morgan’s Laws.

In this chapter, we discussed the logical operators && , || and ! .

De Morgan’s laws can sometimes make it more convenient for us to express
a logical expression. These laws state that the expression
!( condition1 && condition2 ) is logically equivalent to the expression
( ! condition1 || ! condition2 ) .

Also, the expression !( condition1 || condition2 ) is logically equivalent
to the expression ( ! condition1 && ! condition2 ) .

Use De Morgan’s laws to write equivalent expressions for each of the following,
then write a program to show that the original expression and the new expression
in each case are equivalent:

a) !( x < 5 ) && !( y >= 7 )
b) !( a == b ) || !( g != 5 )
c) !( ( x <= 8 ) && ( y > 4 ) )
d) !( ( i > 4 ) || ( j <= 6 ) )
