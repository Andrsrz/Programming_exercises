4.26 Palindromes.
A palindrome is a number or a text phrase that reads the same backward as forward.
For example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554 and 11611.
Write a program that reads in a five-digit integer and determines whether itâ€™s a palindrome.
[Hint: Use the division and modulus operators to separate the number into its individual digits.]
